# Robotics-Estimation-and-Learning
Coursera's Robotics and Signal processing specialization's workspace. As one continues to progress in the course following things one will
get to know and have a practical assignments, helping to apply the learnt concepts using MATLAB

Week-1
---------
1. Gaussian System Model
2. Image Channels and Color extraction
3. Image segmentation using statistical approach

Assignment: Ball Center Detection using segmentation based on color extraction using a Probabilistic approach through 
Gaussian Model Trainning

Week-2
---------
1. Kalman Filter Model for liner variations
2. Idea of Unscented Kalman Filter

Assignment: Ball Localization and Position Estimation using Kalman Filter on Above segmented ball

Week-3
---------
1. 2D Occupancy gird Mapping of a Lidar data
2. Different Bot frames and Multi-Lidar data mapping

Assignment: Mapping of surrounding with given pose,bot location and sensor data
